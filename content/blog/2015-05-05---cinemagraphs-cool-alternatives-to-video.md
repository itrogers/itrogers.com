So I have been kind of in the dark about this upcoming [cinemagraphs](http://cinemagraphs.com/) "trend" in web design recently. I'm glad I was enlightened, because these things are cool! In layman's terms, a cinemagraph looks like a still photo, but only a certain element of it moves. I hope that they become more mainstream in current web design in the near future. I am already looking for a project to use them in!

Okay, yes, cinemagraphs are technically video (based on their file formats), but they are much easier to handle if you use them as a .gif, for both browser and mobile compatibility.

It looks like we have a ways to go before it catches on big time though. [Shutterstock contains only 33 results](http://www.shutterstock.com/video/search/cinemagraph/).
