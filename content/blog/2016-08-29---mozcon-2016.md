description: "See you in Seattle!"

I'm heading to MozCon 2016 in Seattle, and I'm super excited! With the exception of 2015, I've been a MozCon attendee since 2011. I'm very excited to attend again this year. Over the last 2 to 3 years, my business has changed so much. This year, my purpose for going to MozCon is a bit different than past years. I am hoping to:

- Meet quality and top-tier Local SEO's to form partnerships with them.

- Learn more about how web design and development affects Google's impact with a website.

- Learn something new I never thought I needed to learn.
