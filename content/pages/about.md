Thank you for stopping by! This page is simply about me. I’ll give you a quick summary:

- I'm your non-typical "self-taught" web developer/programmer. I love both frontend and backend development, but am often caught attempting to program the right way, over the fast way.
- Technical Co-Founder at [Kohost](https://kohost.io). We're chaning the way you interact with your hotel, for good.
- Founder, Principal, and Web Developer at [Mvestor Media](https://mvestormedia.com). My O.G. "day job".
- Partner, CMO at [Fusch Commercial Interiors & Design](https://fcidesign.com).
- I am interested in all things web, entrepreneurship, and marketing.
- I love to learn. I try to read/listen to 50 – 75 books per year.
- I ~~am currently writing~~ wrote a book on effective web design, called [Websites that Win: 11 Mistakes You Don’t Know You’re Making](https://www.amazon.com/Websites-that-Win-Ian-Rogers/dp/1517005639/).
