At Mvestor and FCI, we use a sales pipeline management tool called [Base](https://getbase.com/). It's basically a [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) for any and all deals/quotes/proposals that are currently active. It helps organize, track, maintain the sales process. If you aren't using

The company who built Base is putting on a [conference in San Francisco called Forecast](http://forecast2015.com/) (props to their website, by the way!). The conference will cover insights into the Base software and (it seems like) sales in general. I grabbed a ticket a few weeks ago for a quick one night trip.

I typically attend industry related conferences - SEO, web design, inbound marketing, etc. This will be my first "sales" oriented conference. I hope to gain a few insights/additional knowledge into the following:

- How to use the Base CRM more effectively (or lesser known features of the software)
- How to sell more effectively/efficiently
- Other tools that play well or integrate with Base

Of course, I am excited to meet and connect with others in the Base and sales community!
