We were working on a blog slider for a client recently, where we were taking advantage of <code class=\"language-text\">the_excerpt()</code> to display a snippet of the blog article. They had <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/tag/sharedaddy/\">Jetpack’s Sharedaddy</a> sharing feature enabled, which by default, was displaying the sharing icons below the post excerpt, which can be useful in some situations, but not ours.</p>\n<p>I did some Google searching, and found some solutions to comment out the filter in <code class=\"language-text\">sharing.php</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">sharing-service.php</code> - which isn’t really an ideal or standardized solution. Instead, I wrote a helper function to place in <code class=\"language-text\">functions.php</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"php\"><pre class=\"language-php\"><code class=\"language-php\">    <span class=\"token comment\">/* Remove Jetpack Sharedaddy Sharing from post excerpts */</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token function\">add_action</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span> <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'init'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'remove_sharedaddy_excerpt_sharing'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function-definition function\">remove_sharedaddy_excerpt_sharing</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n       <span class=\"token function\">remove_filter</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span> <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'the_excerpt'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'sharing_display'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">19</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I plan to add more code snippets and solutions for problems that we will run into in the future.
