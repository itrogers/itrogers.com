It is not a “DIY” book on how to build your own website. It is a collection of topics that will allow you to be more prepared when hiring someone to build it for you.</p>\n<p>You can pickup a hardcopy or Kindle version of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Websites-that-Win-Ian-Rogers/dp/1517005639/\"><em>Websites that Win</em> over at Amazon</a>.
