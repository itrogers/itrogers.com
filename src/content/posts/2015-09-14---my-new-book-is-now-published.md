After several months and lot's of "writer's block", I finally finished my book, entitled, *Websites that Win: 11 Mistakes You Don't Know You're Making.* I am extremely excited that I have completed this process, as I hope it will propel me into the next phase of my business at Mvestor Media.

The book is an essential guide for small business owners to use when creating a website. It is not a "DIY" book on how to build your own website. It is a collection of topics that will allow you to be more prepared when hiring someone to build it for you.

You can pickup a hardcopy or Kindle version of [_Websites that Win_ over at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Websites-that-Win-Ian-Rogers/dp/1517005639/). Enjoy the read!
